With Android Studio Install Android Studio - it's free and awesome! Be aware that it's a long download! Install Git, it's the way for us to work together on this project. UI is optional, Android Studio has good Git tools built in :) Getting the code Create a Github account, if you don't already have one Fork the repo (click the \"Fork\" button on the top-right corner of https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) - this will create a \"copy\" of the code on your account, at https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv Clone your fork with git - the location will be https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv.git, visible from the green \"Clone or download\" button at https://github.com/YourUsername/Unciv Load the project in Android Studio, Gradle will attempt the initial sync. If this is your first time with Android Studio, this may require you to accept the Android Build-tools licenses, which works differently on every device, so search for your OS-specific solution. A new install may not be able to do the initial sync - this comes in the form of Unable to find method ''void org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipFile.<init>(java.nio.channels.SeekableByteChannel)'' errors when you try to sync. If you have this problem go into File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK Click \"SDK Platforms\" Click \"Android 12.0\" Click \"SDK Tools\" Select \"Show Package Details\" in the bottom right Choose version 32.0.0 under \"Android SDK Build-Tools\" Click \"Apply\" In Android Studio, Run > Edit configurations (be sure the Gradle sync is finished successfully first). Click \"+\" to add a new configuration Choose \"Application\" Give the configuration a name, we recommend \"Desktop\" Set the module classpath (the box to the right of the Java selection) to Unciv.desktop.main ( Unciv.desktop for Bumblebee or below), main class to com.unciv.app.desktop.DesktopLauncher and <repo_folder>\\android\\assets\\ as the Working directory, OK to close the window If you get a ../../docs/uniques.md (No such file or directory) error that means you forgot to set the working directory! Select the Desktop configuration (or however you chose to name it) and click the green arrow button to run! Or you can use the next button -the green critter with six legs and two feelers - to start debugging. A few Android Studio settings that are recommended: Going to Settings > Version Control > Commit and turning off 'Before commit - perform code analysis' Settings > Editor > Code Style > Kotlin > Tabs and Indents > Continuation Indent: 4 Settings > Editor > General > On Save > Uncheck Remove trailing spaces on: [...] to prevent it from removing necessary trailing whitespace in template.properties for translation files Unciv uses Gradle to specify dependencies and how to run. In the background, the Gradle gnomes will be off fetching the packages (a one-time effort) and, once that's done, will build the project! Unciv uses Gradle 7.2 and the Android Gradle Plugin 7.1.3. Can check in File > Project Structure > Project Note advanced build commands as described in the next paragraph, specifically the gradlew desktop:dist one to build a jar, run just fine in Android Studio's terminal (Alt+F12), with most dependencies already taken care of. Without Android Studio If you also have JDK 11 installed, you can compile Unciv on your own by cloning (or downloading and unzipping) the project, opening a terminal in the Unciv folder and run the following commands: Windows Running: gradlew desktop:run Building: gradlew desktop:dist Linux/Mac OS Running: ./gradlew desktop:run Building: ./gradlew desktop:dist If the terminal returns Permission denied or Command not found on Mac/Linux, run chmod +x ./gradlew first. This is a one-time procedure. If you get an error that Android SDK folder wasn't found, firstly install it by doing in terminal: sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-sdk (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc.) After that you should put its folder to the file local.properties by adding this line: sdk.dir = /path/to/android/sdk which can be /usr/lib/android-sdk or something other. If during the first launch it throws an error that the JDK version is wrong try to install JDK from here . Gradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. After building, the output .JAR file should be in /desktop/build/libs/Unciv.jar For actual development, you'll probably need to download Android Studio and build it yourself - see Contributing :) UncivServer The simple multiplayer host included in the sources can be set up to debug or run analogously to the main game: - In Android Studio, Run > Edit configurations. - Click \"+\" to add a new configuration - Choose \"Application\" and name the config, e.g. \"UncivServer\" - Set the module to Unciv.server.main ( Unciv.server for Studio versions Bumblebee or below), main class to com.unciv.app.server.DesktopLauncher and <repo_folder>/android/assets/ as the Working directory, OK to close the window. - Select the UncivServer configuration and click the green arrow button to run!

Some of our will be obvious to you, some will not. Use Kotlin Unciv started its life as a Unity project in C#, was shifted to Java and LibGDX, and finally to Kotlin. I regret every minute that I spent writing events in Java, this is probably the most significant change that your application could see. Use Scene2d Unless you plan on creating images on the fly, you'll probably be using prerendered assets. Placing them manually is akin to manually positioning html tags, instead of using html hierarchy and css to guide positions. So too is Scene2d - as a placement framework. it's relatively simple to understand, especially when you... Ignore Horizontal and Vertical groups - use Table I personally found that table has all the functionality of the above, and more. Each class has a different syntax too, so I found it much simpler to just stick with Table for everything. Table does just about EVERYTHING! It's insanely amazing! If your game is getting slow, use the Android profiler in Android Studio The top-down CPU chart is the best code profiler I've ever seen, use it to your advantage! Cache everything Caching is a trade-off between purer, state-agnostic code and higher performance. Coming from a PC background, I automatically assume that anything less than O(n^2) is less than a millisecond and therefore, not a caching candidate. This is not so in mobile development. This becomes especially relevant when you need to save and load game data which has lots of connected parts - you have to avoid circular references, and you want to minimise the save size, but you need to reconstruct the missing links when loading. Minimize String operations All the tip and tricks you've heard to minimize String operations? Use them! String constants should be consts, use StringBuilders (or just ArrayLists of strings that you later .joinToString()) Sequences everywhere! One thing I did not expect to be such an issue is intermediate lists when sorting and mapping. But apparently, the memory allocation for these tasks is Serious Business. So whenever possible, take your list and .asSequence() it before activating list operations - this results in huge savings of both time and memory! The only time you shouldn't be doing this, though, is when you want to cache the specific values for future use - sequences will go through the whole process every time you iterate on them, so just .toList() them when you've gotten the final results! General tips for making an Open Source game Lower the entry bar - for both programmers and players I think that most Open Source games suffer from this problem - those that are in are way in, but those that are out and want to join have to learn the ecosystem. Documentation is a big issue here, but so are detailed instructions - and I mean \"Spoonfeeding\". Treat new developers as if they've never used Git before - it's possible they haven't! Explain how to download the sourecode, the tools, how to get the game running locally, how to make changes and how to submit them. Same think with new players - getting the game up and running should be AS SIMPLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE - you want people to play your game, don't you? This includes: Source-To-Executable automation - I use Travis Play stores and the like Internal game tutorials - your players will NEVER BE SATISFIED with this last point, but at least do what you candidate Community, Community, Community! I, personally, underestimated this point for about a year after launch. I communicated with players through the Google Play Store and Github issues, and that seemed to be enough. It was only after repeated urgings from players that I opened a Discord server - and that gradually lead to a massive change! You see, it's not ABOUT programmer-to-player interaction. There will always be a small number of core devs relative to the large playerbase. The key to the community is the player-to-player interaction. Explaining things, questions, ideas, things that players bounce off each other, not only make the amorphous community a better place, but actually lead to a better game! Another think to remember is that there's a larger community around you - the Open Source community, the Linux community, etc. There are lots of people who will play your game only because it's open source, and it also means they don't have as many options. For example... Being the best 4X game means competing with the biggest names out there Being the best 4X game for Linux means many less competitors, but All The Cool Kids (tm) are multiplatforming nowadays so you're still outperformed. Being the best Open Source 4X game means about 5 competitors, and no money is involved either so the average entry is not as polished. Being the best Open Source 4X game for Android... means having so few competitors that it's totally doable. Everything is marketing. Your game's name, the icon, screenshots, everything a player sees about your game is marketing. Icons and bylines are especially important, since they're the first things your players will probably see. I saw an almost 50% (!) by changing the icon, after several experiments, which Google Play lets you conduct very easily. Translations are part of your source code This may be slightly controversial, so I'll explain. We went though a number of iterations regarding how to save translations until we arrived at the current format. The important parts are: Game translation files should be AUTO GENERATED. This allows you to add new objects into the game with impunity, knowing that corresponding lines will be auto-added to the translations. Translations for each language should be stored separately - this allows concurrent modification of several independent languages with no risk of conflict Translations should be PR'd in! This allows other speakers to question or change the proposed translations, and allows you to run tests on your translations. If you require a specific format, this is invaluable as it means that bad translations will be rejected at the door. Open source problems require open (source?) solutions TL;DR, consider using APIs that are free, even if they're not Open Source. Multiplayer requires syncing game files between clients, even when one of them is not currently online. The 'correct' way to solve this would probably be to have an online DB and a service which handles user requests. Since this is an Open Source game, I'm working on a 0$ budget, so we just store all the files in Dropbox and upload/download there. Is this secure? No, but does it need to be? You need to think of the cost vs the value. Same thing with Mods. Steam is big and secure so it handles its mods itself. We are small and open, so we just allow to download from Github, which lets us use all of Github's built in functions (user management, readmes, stars, versioning...) at no extra cost. And unlike the Dropbox usage, which is basically abuse, Github is built for this kind of thing! This is exactly the kind of use case they were thinking of to start with! The Reckoning There comes a time in every project where the cool stuff is done. All the cutting-edge awesomeness and algorithmic playdough is done, and now all (hah) it needs is polish. You know who loves polish? Players! Sure, there are some that say \"a good game is good even if it's basic\" but they have standards for what a basic game should have as well. And the numbers don't lie. Polished games sell themselves better, and so are played more. You know who doesn't love polish? DEVELOPERS. When your game is relatively simple, then the options for polish are more limited, but the more complex the game, the more polish-venues there are. And it can be an ABSOLUTE GRIND. Another weird use-case, another ingame option, \"better performance\" (I must have spent dozens of hours on different performance related actions) And the worst thing is, that everyone notices when it's missing, but no one notices when it's there. A hundred versions of polish - literally - and the average player may notice only a slight change. And then comes the moment when you ask yourself, why bother? What are we even doing here? For me, the answers are as follows: A. To build something truly great, you have to keep going way beyond when it stops being fun. B. There's a community of people that like what you're doing and want there to be more of it :) C. You know you want to keep coding, and what, you think you're going to start another project and it'll work out as well? You've tried that multiple times, and let's face it the chance of you making a second game that goes so well is really small unless you invest in it as much time as you have in this, and yeah, then you'll be back in this position again. And that's basically the loop I've been in for the last hundred versions or so! Solve bugs, fix edge cases, improve AI, accept PRs. Lots of mod-related changes, both to stop the game breaking when people do things in mods that they shouldn't and to allow them more freedom in making them. I don't think I'll ever really continue to finish G&K, I'm DEFINITELY not planning on implementing BNW mechanics which frankly I think are...not great. That's where I am right now. Kind of done with the game, but considering that I thought that half a year ago and releases are still releasing roughly every week, also kind of not.","title":"Game Making Tips"},{"location":"Developers/Game-Making-Tips/#game-making-tips","text":"","title":"Game Making Tips"},{"location":"Developers/Game-Making-Tips/#tips-and-tricks-for-making-a-libgdx-game","text":"Here are a bunch of things I've learned from by brief excursion into the world of game making.

Explain how to download the sourecode, the tools, how to get the game running locally, how to make changes and how to submit them. Same think with new players - getting the game up and running should be AS SIMPLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE - you want people to play your game, don't you?

It was only after repeated urgings from players that I opened a Discord server - and that gradually lead to a massive change! You see, it's not ABOUT programmer-to-player interaction. There will always be a small number of core devs relative to the large playerbase. The key to the community is the player-to-player interaction. Explaining things, questions, ideas, things that players bounce off each other, not only make the amorphous community a better place, but actually lead to a better game! Another think to remember is that there's a larger community around you - the Open Source community, the Linux community, etc. There are lots of people who will play your game only because it's open source, and it also means they don't have as many options. For example... Being the best 4X game means competing with the biggest names out there Being the best 4X game for Linux means many less competitors, but All The Cool Kids (tm) are multiplatforming nowadays so you're still outperformed. Being the best Open Source 4X game means about 5 competitors, and no money is involved either so the average entry is not as polished.

We went though a number of iterations regarding how to save translations until we arrived at the current format. The important parts are: Game translation files should be AUTO GENERATED. This allows you to add new objects into the game with impunity, knowing that corresponding lines will be auto-added to the translations. Translations for each language should be stored separately - this allows concurrent modification of several independent languages with no risk of conflict Translations should be PR'd in! This allows other speakers to question or change the proposed translations, and allows you to run tests on your translations.

The 'correct' way to solve this would probably be to have an online DB and a service which handles user requests. Since this is an Open Source game, I'm working on a 0$ budget, so we just store all the files in Dropbox and upload/download there. Is this secure? No, but does it need to be? You need to think of the cost vs the value. Same thing with Mods. Steam is big and secure so it handles its mods itself. We are small and open, so we just allow to download from Github, which lets us use all of Github's built in functions (user management, readmes, stars, versioning...) at no extra cost. And unlike the Dropbox usage, which is basically abuse, Github is built for this kind of thing!

All the cutting-edge awesomeness and algorithmic playdough is done, and now all (hah) it needs is polish. You know who loves polish? Players! Sure, there are some that say \"a good game is good even if it's basic\" but they have standards for what a basic game should have as well. And the numbers don't lie. Polished games sell themselves better, and so are played more. You know who doesn't love polish? DEVELOPERS. When your game is relatively simple, then the options for polish are more limited, but the more complex the game, the more polish-venues there are. And it can be an ABSOLUTE GRIND. Another weird use-case, another ingame option, \"better performance\" (I must have spent dozens of hours on different performance related actions) And the worst thing is, that everyone notices when it's missing, but no one notices when it's there. A hundred versions of polish - literally - and the average player may notice only a slight change. And then comes the moment when you ask yourself, why bother? What are we even doing here? For me, the answers are as follows: A. To build something truly great, you have to keep going way beyond when it stops being fun. B. There's a community of people that like what you're doing and want there to be more of it :) C. You know you want to keep coding, and what, you think you're going to start another project and it'll work out as well? You've tried that multiple times, and let's face it the chance of you making a second game that goes so well is really small unless you invest in it as much time as you have in this, and yeah, then you'll be back in this position again. And that's basically the loop I've been in for the last hundred versions or so! Solve bugs, fix edge cases, improve AI, accept PRs. Lots of mod-related changes, both to stop the game breaking when people do things in mods that they shouldn't and to allow them more freedom in making them. I don't think I'll ever really continue to finish G&K, I'm DEFINITELY not planning on implementing BNW mechanics which frankly I think are...not great. That's where I am right now.

Images in LibGDX are displayed on screen by a SpriteBatch, which uses GL to bind textures to load them in-memory, and can then very quickly display them on-screen. The actually rendering is then very fast, but the binding process is slow. Therefore ideally we'd want as little bindings as possible, so the textures should contain as many images as possible. This is why we compile images (ImagePacker.packImages()) into large PNGs. However, due to limitations in different chipsets etc, these images are limited to a maximum size of 2048*2048 pixels, and the game contains more images than would fit into a single square of that size. What we do, then, is separate them by category, and thus rendering proximity. The 'android' folder contains Images, but also various sub-categories - Images.Flags, Images.Tech, etc. Each of these sub-categories is compiled into a separate PNG file in the 'android/assets' folder. When rendering, the major time-sink is in rebinding textures. We therefore need to be careful to minimize the number of -rebinds, or 'swapping between different categories'. Layering Each map tile is comprised of several layers, and each layer needs to be rendered for all tiles before the next layer is. For example, we don't want one tile's unit sprite to be overlayed by another's improvement. This layering is done in TileGroupMap, where we take the individual parts for all tiles, separate them into the layers, and add them all to one big group. This also has a performance advantage, since e.g. text and contruction images in the various city buttons are not rendered until the very end, and therefore swap per the number of of cities and not for every single tile. This also means that mods which add their own tilesets or unit sprites have better performance than 'render entire tile; would provide, since we first render all terrains, then all improvements, etc, so if my tileset provides all terrains, it won't be swapped out until we're done. Debugging Android Studio's built-in profiler has a CPU profiler which is perfect for this. Boot up the game on your Android device, open a game, start recording CPU, move the screen around a bit, and stop recording.

Sometimes you may not need to do anything, sometimes you will add a line to the translation templates , and sometimes you will adapt the string formatting to support the translations. For details, see the 'Translation generation - for developers' chapter . Major classes Civ, and therefore Unciv, is a game with endless interconnectivity - everything affects everything else. In order to have some semblance of order, we'll go over the main classes in the order in which they are serialized. So yes, you can - for instance - get the center tile of a city, a TileInfo, directly from CityInfo. But delving into all the connections would only harm the point of this overview, that's what the actual code is for ;) The Game State: GameInfo CivilizationInfo CityInfo TileMap TileInfo MapUnit RuleSet (unique in that it is not part of the game state) The UI: MainMenuScreen NewGameScreen WorldScreen CityScreen MapEditorScreen Picker Screens - TechPickerScreen, PolicyPickerScreen, ImprovementPickerScreen, PromotionPickerScreen Game State The Game - GameInfo First off, let's clarify: When we say \"The Game\", we mean the state of the game (what turn it is, who the players are, what each one has etc) and not the UI of the game. That is, The Game is the currently playe _ game, not Unciv . The game contains three major parts: The list of the players, or civilizations - List<CivilizationInfo> The map upon which the game is played - TileMap The ruleset by which the game is played - RuleSet . This includes what technologies, buildings, units etc. are available, and IS NOT serialized and deserialized, but comes straight from the game files - more on that later. Parameters unique to this game - difficulty, game speed, victory conditions, etc. When we save the game, or load the game, we're actually serializing and deserializing this class, which means that the this class is the root of the entire game state. Most objects in the \"state tree\" have a transient reference to their parent, meaning the tree can be traversed in-code in all directions, and frequently is. A Civilization - CivilizationInfo This represents one of the players of the game, and NOT a specific nation - meaning, not France, but rather \"Player X who is France in this game\". In another game, there will be another France. As one of the focal points of the game, it contains a lot of important information, the most important of which are: The list of cities the civilization has - List<CityInfo> Which nation this is - references a certain Nation (part of the ruleset) Various Managers for the different aspects of the civilization - PolicyManager , GoldenAgeManager , GreatPersonManager , TechManager , VictoryManager , DiplomacyManager A City - CityInfo This contains the information about a specific city. Beyond basic information like name, location on map etc, the most important classes it contains are: Calculating the yield of the city - CityStats Managers for the various aspects - PopulationManager , CityConstructions , CityExpansionManager The tiles controlled and worked by the city - only their locations are permanently saved in the CityInfo, the actual information is in the TileInfo in the TileMap The map - TileMap This contains mostly helper functions and acts as a wrapper for the list of tiles it contains A tile - TileInfo Each tile is comprised of several layers, and so has information for each. Tiles have, primarily: A base terrain - Grassland, Hills, Desert etc. References a certain Terrain (part of the ruleset) An optional terrain feature - Forest, Jungle, Oasis etc. References a certain Terrain (part of the ruleset) An optional resource - Iron, Dye, Wheat etc. References a certain TileResource (part of the ruleset) An improvement built on the tile, if any. References a certain TileImprovement (part of the ruleset) The units that are currently in the tile - MapUnit A unit on the map - MapUnit Unlike buildings, Unit in Unciv has two meanings. One is a Type of unit (like Spearman), and one is a specific instance of a unit (say, a Babylonian Spearman, at a certain position, with X health). MapUnit is a specific instance of a unit, whereas BaseUnit is the type of unit. Main information: A name - references a specific BaseUnit Health and Movement Promotion status - UnitPromotions Ruleset So far so good - but what of everything that makes Civ, Civ? The units, the buildings, the nations, the improvements etc? Since these things remain the same for every game, these are not saved on a per-game basis, but rather are saved in json files in Unciv's asset folder. Each class in the game state that saves one of these will reference it by name, and when the game is running it will check the Ruleset to find the relevant information for that object. The various objects are: Technology - referenced mainly in CivilizationInfo.TechManager Nations - referenced mainly in CivilizationInfo Policy - referenced mainly in CivilizationInfo.PolicyManager (seeing a pattern here?) Building - referenced mainly in CityInfo.ConstructionManager BaseUnit - referenced mainly in MapUnit Promotion - referenced mainly in MapUnit Terrain - referenced mainly in TileInfo TileResource - referenced mainly in TileInfo TileImprovement - referenced mainly in TileInfo There are also Translations in the Ruleset, but they technically have nothing to do with the game state but rather with the UI display. The information for all of these is in json files in android\\assets\\jsons UI UncivGame is the 'base' class for the UI, from which everything starts, but it itself doesn't do much. When we change a screen, we're changing a value in UncivGame, the interesting stuff happens in the screens themselves. The main menu - MainMenuScreen This is what the user sees when first entering the game. It acts as a hub to loading games, adding mods, options etc, without loading an actual game upfront - this allows us to differentiate between \"User can't enter game\" and \"User can't load game\" problems Starting a new game - NewGameScreen This is basically a giant setting screen for GameOptions and MapOptions classes, divided into: GameOptionsTable - game speed, mods, etc MapOptionsTable - either from preexisting map file or generated, in which case: size, map generation type, etc. PlayerPickerTable - What civs are in the game and who controls them The World Screen - WorldScreen 90% of the game is spent on this screen, so naturally it's the fullest, with the most things happening. This is the main hub of the game, with all other screens being opened from it, and closing back to reveal it. Most notable are: The map itself - a TileMapHolder - with each of the rendered tiles being a TileGroup The information panels - WorldScreenTopBar for stats and resources, UnitTable for the currently selected unit, TileInfoTable or the currently selected tile, BattleTable for battle simulation, and NotificationsScroll for the notifications The minimap - MinimapHolder Buttons linking to other screens - to the TechPickerScreen , EmpireOverviewScreen , and PolicyPickerScreen The almighty Next Turn button The city screen - CityScreen The second-most important screen. Notable parts: the City Stats table - should definitely be its own class come to think of it The construction list and current construction (bottom left) - ConstructionsTable Existing buildings, specialists and stats drilldown - CityInfoTable Others A few words need to be said about the NextTurn process, but there isn't really a good place for it so I'll put it here. We clone the GameInfo and use a \"new\" GameInfo for each turn because of 2 reasons. The first is multithreading and thread safety, and the second is multiplayer reproducibility. The first point is pretty basic. The NextTurn needs to happen in a separate thread so that the user can still have a responsive game when it's off doing stuff. Stuff in the GameInfo changes on NextTurn, so if you're rendering that same GameInfo, this could cause conflicts. Also, after NextTurn we generally autosave, and if stuff changes in the state while we're trying to serialize it to put it in the save file, that's Not Fun. A single clone solves both of these problems at once. The second point is less obvious. If we use our mutable state, changing stuff in place, then what happens when we're playing in Multiplayer?

In terms of UI, there's nothing here that hasn't been done dozens of times, with far greater polish. However, there is one area where Unciv is groundbreaking: in its accessibility of translations, the possibility space of its mods, and the relationship between them. Translations The translation process So let's start with translation. Surely this is a solved problem, right? Source text + language = translated text, and this information needs to be in a file so the game can read it. What makes us different from, for example, Firaxis? There are a couple of things, but the most significant is that this is an open-source game, and thus the translations are open-source as well. This means translators are both amateurs and not obligated to translate, so if translating is difficult, they simply won't. Amateurs can make mistakes, which is why it's vital that mistakes are easy to spot. That means that formats like \"translation key\" - e.g. DIPLOMACY_GREETING = Siamo lieti di fare la vostra conoscenza. are much less effective than A pleasure to meet you. = Siamo lieti di fare la vostra conoscenza. This format lends itself both the easier translation (it's immediately obvious what needs to be translated) and actual collaboration. A common suggestion that we get (by people with little familiarity with the project) is to \"use a website for translation\". This is not bad advice for a small open source game, but there are multiple disadvantages that (for now) no translation website provides enough advantage to outweigh: Testing . Currently, translations undergo a number of tests for verification - more on that later! This allows some language changes to be accepted and others not, and it's all in the same platform with the same tests. External translation tools don't allow for this. History and revisions . This is what Git was made for, and nothing like it exists in the world. By itself this would not Release cycle . We release versions semiweekly, and if we needed to upload changes to the translation website for every in-game change, and download them for every release, that's extra work. For some websites this is automate-able - for most it is not. Discussions . Most crowdsourcing translation websites don't allow for discussions and corrections on translations. Github makes every translation collaborative work. Mass changes . If we're changing the source of the translation but want to keep the various destinations (say, we change \"Gold from trade routes +[amount]%\" to \"+[amount]% Gold from trade routes\"), if all the translation files are in Git we can do that in 1 minute. If it's external, this varies greatly. Here are some ways that we managed to go wrong in the past: Putting all languages into the same file (\"one big translation dictionary\") - when multiple people edit this file for different languages, they can conflict with each other. Separate to different files for simpler management. Using json - json is great for machines, but less so for humans, who can easily make mistakes. Json format is surprisingly finnicky, miss a closing \" and the whole file is now unreadable. The format we decided to go for is one file per language, delimited by \" = \" for visual separation, in a .properties file. Lines starting in # are considered comments, so we can add comments for translators. Building the translation files As stated, Unciv releases versions semiweekly, and very often these changes include new objects or new UI elements. How do we keep all translation files up to date? In Unciv, all object data is stored in json format. This allows us to iterate on all objects, regardless of type, and extract the various text fields (strings or lists of strings). We avoid duplication by saving all translation texts we've already added, and use the existing translations to populate the \"value\" for each translation \"key\" we found in the json files. Since we rebuild the entire translation file every time, there's currently no way for translators to retain their own comments for future translators. But on the other hand, since for each line that we add we already know if it's translated or not, this allows us to add a # Requires translation line before every non-translated line, which helps translators for languages that are almost fully translated to easily locate the new or changed terms for translation with ctrl+f (and of course this marking will disappear the next time we rebuild the file). Since there are UI texts that are not part of any specific object (like \"Start new game\"), we have a separate template.properties file for texts to translate that are not in the json files. Unlike adding objects, where the developer doesn't need to address the translation files at all since it's all linked, when adding UI elements with new texts devs need to remember to add the texts to template.properties file. Translation placeholders This is all well and good for specific text-to-text translations, but what about translating \"A Temple has been built in Rome\"? The same template could potentially be any building name, or any city name! We do this with placeholders, which looks something like this: [construction] has been built in [cityName] = [cityName] ha costruito [construction] . As you can see, the placement of the parameters can change between languages, so we have to name all parameters. This also means that there can be explicitly wrong translations - if any parameter that appears in the source does not appear in the translated version, we won't be able to display this in-game! This is one of the translation tests that we mentioned earlier - when a translator opens a PR, the game undergoes build & test via the Github Actions, and will notify on failures. Finding the text that warns of the failure within the action output is currently mostly done by devs, but I hope to be able to automate this too someday. To translate a text like \"[Temple] has been built in [Rome]\", therefore, we need to: Find the relevant translation (we do this by erasing all text between square brackets in input and finding the relevant translation text) Map placeholder names to input text (construction = Temple, cityName = Rome) Replace placeholders in translation with TRANSLATED input text (in [cityName] ha costruito [construction] , replace \"[cityName]\" with translation of \"Rome\", and \"[construction]\" with translation of \"Temple\") Translating mod data The translation generation reads information from \"a ruleset\", i.e. the set of jsons defining the game's objects. Every mod is also a ruleset, either replacing or adding to the base ruleset defined in the game. This means that the same translation generation that we do for the base game can also be applied to mods, and so each modder can decide (from within the game) to generate translation files for his mod, and since mods are uploaded to Github to be widely available as part of the mod release methodology, translators will be able to translate those files the exact same way that they translate Unciv's base ruleset. Uniques Moddable unique effects Every object in Unciv can include \"uniques\" - a list of strings, each granting a unique effect that is not applicable for every object of its type. For example, the Palace building has the unique \"Indicates the capital city\", and the settler has the unique \"Founds a new city\". This allows us to share effects between multiple units, and to avoid hardcoding and allow modders to add any effect to any object. Here too we encounter the problem of \"generic\" uniques - how can we have these effects grant a building, some stats, etc, using the same unique for all objects? Why, with placeholders of course! For example, one building has \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\", where \"Library\" can be replaced with any other building for similar effects. We can then extract the parameters from the unique at runtime, to know how to resolve the unique's effects. Since the translation template is the same as the unique template, these uniques are instantly translatable as well! We do have a slight problem, though - since translation texts come directly from the json files, and the json files have \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\", how do we tell the translators not to directly translate \"Library\" but the take the parameter name verbatim? Well, 95% of translation parameters fit nicely into a certain type - units, buildings, techs, terrains etc. So we can search for an object with than name, and since we find a Library building, we can put \"Requires a [buildingName] in all cities = \" as our translation line. Filters As time went on, we noticed that many of our \"uniques\" weren't so unique after all. Many were the same but with slightly different conditions. One affects all cities, one only coastal cities, and one only the city the building is built in. One affects Mounted units, one affects wounded units, one affects all water units, etc. We started compiling these conditions into \"filters\", which limited the number of uniques while expanding their range considerably. Take the following example unique for a building: \"[+1 Food] from [Deer] tiles [in this city]\". In its \"placeholder\" form, this is \"[stats] from [tileFilter] tiles [cityFilter]\". stats can accept any list of stats, e.g. '-2 Gold, +1 Science', '+3 Culture', etc. tileFilter can accept any number of tile parameters (base terrain e.g. 'Plains', terrain type eg. 'Land'/'Water', terrain features e.g. 'Forest', improvements e.g. 'Mine', resources e.g. 'Iron'. cityFilter can accept 'in this city', 'in all cities', 'in capital', 'in coastal cities', etc. There are also filters for units, all acceptable values are documented here . Unique management with Enums The further along we go, the more generic the uniques become, and the more of them there are. Older uniques become new ones, by being merged or made more generic, and the older ones are deprecated. Deprecation notices are put on Discord, but a one-time message is easy to miss, and if you come back after a while you don't know what's changed. Modders discover during gameplay that the values they put for uniques were incorrect. All these problems are solved with a single solution - since all uniques are defined by their text, we can create an enum with ALL existing uniques, which lets us: Find all usages of a unique in the IDE instantly Mark deprecated uniques as such using @Deprecated(\"as of <versionNumber\">) for devs (and modders!) Compare uniques using enum values, which is faster What's more, with a little bit of autodetection magic, we can determine the type of the parameter using its text. Using the above example, \"[stats] from [tileFilter] tiles [cityFilter]\", we can tell by the names of the parameters what each one is supposed to be,. We can then check at loading time for each unique, if its parameter values matches the parameter type it's supposed to have, which lets us catch incorrect parameters. The \"autodetection\" of parameter types for translations can also be fed from here, leading to much more accurate translation texts - instead of detecting from an example (e.g. \"Requires a [Library] in all cities\" from the json), we now use a dev-inputted value like \"Requires a [buildingName] in all cities\". This allows us to accept multiple types, like for e.g. \"Requires [buildingName/techName/policyName]\". Deprecated values can be detected due to the @Deprecated annotation, and can be displayed to the modders when loading the mod, together with the correct replacement. Conditionals Beyond the existing filters for units, buildings, tiles etc, there are some conditions that are global. For example, uniques that take effect when the empire is happy; when a tech has been researched; when the empire is at war; etc. Rather than being 'build in' to specific uniques, these conditions can be seen as extensions of existing uniques and thus globally relevant. For example, instead of \"[+1 Production] [in all cities] when empire is happy\", we can extract the conditional to \"[+1 Production] [in all cities] \". This does two things: A. Turns the 'extra' unique back into a regular \"[stats] [cityFilter]\" unique B. Turns the conditional into an extra piece that can be added onto any other unique Conditionals have a lot of nuance, especially regarding translation and ordering, so work in that field is more gradual. What's next? We have yet to fully map all existing uniques and convert all textual references in the code to Enum usages, and have yet to extract all conditionals from their uniques. We already have a map of what uniques can be put on what objects - it won't take much to add that check as well and warn against uniques that are put on the wrong sorts of objects. Once we build the full inventory of the uniques, instead of the wiki page that needs to be updated manually we'll be able to generate a list of all acceptable uniques and their parameters directly from the source of truth. Put that in a webpage, add hover-links for each parameter type, generate and upload to github.io every version, and watch the magic happen. We'll also be able to notify modders if they use \"unknown\" uniques.","title":"Translations, mods, and modding freedom in Open Source"},{"location":"Developers/Translations%2C-mods%2C-and-modding-freedom-in-Open-Source/#translations-mods-and-modding-freedom-in-open-source","text":"Unciv is, at its core, a remake of Civ V, meaning mechanics-wise there's almost by definition not much place for innovation.

Let's look at the example \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" to learn how the game decides which images it should use for this tile: When there is a rule variant entry in the tileset config for this tile we will use the entry. Else if there is an image called \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" we will use it instead. Otherwise, we will check if there is an image called \"Grassland+Jungle\" (BaseTerrain+Terrainfeatures) and \"Dyes+Trading post\" (Resource+Improvement) and use the remainings of it. Let's say you made an image called \"Grassland+Jungle\" but none called \"Dyes+Trading post\". In the end, we will then use the images \"Grassland+Jungle\", \"Dyes\" and \"Trading post\". All these images can also use era-dependant variants if you want to change the appearance of, let's say, \"Trading post\" throughout the game. Just create images and add the suffix \"-[era name]\". E.g. \"Trading post-Classical era\", \"Trading post-Industrial era\", etc. It is advised to use the layered approach (1 and 3) often because it comes with a few advantages. Mainly: Decreased filesize (on disk, for downloads) Easier support for new terrains, improvements, resources, and for changing existing tiles You should keep in mind that the default rendering order is: BaseTerrain, TerrainFeatures, Resource, Improvement. Tileset config This is where tileset configs shine. You can use these to alter the way Unicv renders tiles. To create a config for your tileset you just need to create a new .json file under Jsons/Tilesets/. Just create a .txt file and rename it to MyCoolTilesetExample.json. You only have to add things if you want to change them. Else the default values will be used. This is an example of such a config file that will be explain below: \"useColorAsBaseTerrain\" : \"false\" , \"useSummaryImages\" : \"true\" , \"unexploredTileColor\" : { \"r\" : 1 , \"g\" : 1 , \"b\" : 1 , \"a\" : 1 }, \"fogOfWarColor\" : { \"r\" : 1 , \"g\" : 0 , \"b\" : 0 , \"a\" : 1 }, \"fallbackTileSet\" : null , \"tileScale\" : 0.9 , \"tileScales\" : { \"City center\" : 1.2 , \"Citadel\" : 1.5 } \"ruleVariants\" : { \"Grassland+Forest\" : [ \"Grassland\" , \"ForestForGrassland\" ], \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" : [ \"Grassland\" , \"JungleForGrasslandBack\" , \"Dyes+Trading post\" , \"JungleForGrasslandFront\" ] } useColorAsBaseTerrain A boolean value (\"true\" or \"false\"). Default value: \"false\" If true, an additional \"Hexagon\" image is placed below each tile and colored in the corresponding BaseTerrain color. This removes the necessity to add individual BaseTerrain images. This is how the \"Minimal\" tileset works. useSummaryImages A boolean value (\"true\" or \"false\"). Default value: \"false\" If true, summary images are used for specific groups of images instead of using individual tile images. The summary images must be placed in the same folder as every other tile image. Summary images used: Image group Summary image Natural wonders \"NaturalWonder\" unexploredTileColor A color defined with normalized RGBA values. Default value: \"{\"r\":0.24705882, \"g\":0.24705882, \"b\":0.24705882, \"a\":1}\" (DarkGray) Defines the color of the unexplored tiles. fogOfWarColor A color defined with normalized RGBA values. Default value: \"{\"r\":0, \"g\":0, \"b\":0, \"a\":1}\" (Black) Defines the color of the fog of war. The color gets approximated by 60% to allow the colors of the images below to shine through. fallbackTileSet A string value. Default value: \"FantasyHex\" The name of another tileset whose images should be used if this tileset is missing images. Can be set to null to disable the the fallback tileset tileScale A float value. Default value: 1.0 The scale of all tiles. Can be used to increase or decrease the size of every tile. Is being used by the tileset mod 5Hex (made by ravignir) to fake shadows. tileScales A dictionary mapping string to a float value. Default value: empty Used by the \"Minimal\" tileset to scale all its tiles except the base terrain down. Each entry overrides the tileScale value for the specified tile. ruleVariants A dictionary mapping string to a list of strings. Default value: empty The ruleVariants are the most powerful part of the tileset config. With this, you can define, for a specific tile, which images and in which order these images should be used. An example is given in the code above. For the tile \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" we then use the images \"Grassland\", \"JungleForGrasslandBack\", \"Dyes+Trading post\" and \"JungleForGrasslandFront\" in that order. Unit images Unit images can be changed according to civ-specific styles (if a mod specifies a \"style\" variable for each civilization) and according to the owning civ's current era. Unciv attempts to load the unit images in the following order (where unitName is the unit name given in Units.json, styleName is optionally specified in Nations.json, and eraName is the era name given in Eras.json (including \" era\")). unitName-styleName-eraName (example: \"Archer-customStyle1-Classical era.png\") unitName-eraName (example: \"Archer-Classical era.png\") unitName-styleName (example: \"Archer-customStyle1.png\") unitName (example: \"Archer.png\") Era-specific sprites do not need to be specified for each era, only on eras where the sprites change. If a modder wants a Great General unit to change sprites starting in the Modern era, they only need to create a \"Great General-Modern era.png\" image. The Great General unit would use the default \"Great General.png\" sprite for all eras up to the Modern era then the Modern era sprite for the Modern era and all eras after unless there is a later era sprite for this unit. Nation-coloured units Unciv can colour units according to the civilization that owns them. [PR3231] This is used by providing multiple images per unit, each representing a coloured layer. The image suffixed with \"-1\" will be tinted to the civilization's inner colour, and the image suffixed with \"-2\" will be tinted to the civilization's outer colour. For example: Image Description Colour Archer.png Base image Untinted Archer-1.png Colour layer Nation inner colour Archer-2.png Colour layer Nation outer colour The Civ Army Color Style Sheet mod by @AdityaMH and the 5Hex Tileset by @ravignir are very good practical examples of how this can be used.","title":"How to make Unciv use your custom tileset"},{"location":"Modders/Creating-a-custom-tileset/#how-to-make-unciv-use-your-custom-tileset","text":"You should read the Mods page first before proceeding In order to add a tileset mod (yes, tilesets are just another type of mod), all you need to do is add your images under Images/Tilesets/MyCoolTilesetExample and enable the mod as a permanent visual mod - the game will recognize the tileset, and allow you to pick it in the options menu. Let's look at the example \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" to learn how the game decides which images it should use for this tile: When there is a rule variant entry in the tileset config for this tile we will use the entry. Else if there is an image called \"Grassland+Jungle+Dyes+Trading post\" we will use it instead. Otherwise, we will check if there is an image called \"Grassland+Jungle\" (BaseTerrain+Terrainfeatures) and \"Dyes+Trading post\" (Resource+Improvement) and use the remainings of it. Let's say you made an image called \"Grassland+Jungle\" but none called \"Dyes+Trading post\". In the end, we will then use the images \"Grassland+Jungle\", \"Dyes\" and \"Trading post\". All these images can also use era-dependant variants if you want to change the appearance of, let's say, \"Trading post\" throughout the game. Just create images and add the suffix \"-[era name]\". E.g. \"Trading post-Classical era\", \"Trading post-Industrial era\", etc. It is advised to use the layered approach (1 and 3) often because it comes with a few advantages. Mainly: Decreased filesize (on disk, for downloads) Easier support for new terrains, improvements, resources, and for changing existing tiles You should keep in mind that the default rendering order is: BaseTerrain, TerrainFeatures, Resource, Improvement.","title":"How to make Unciv use your custom tileset"},{"location":"Modders/Creating-a-custom-tileset/#tileset-config","text":"This is where tileset configs shine.

It is either selected for the current game (during new game creation, cannot be changed after that for saved games), meaning all its rules and resources will be used. Or it is marked as 'Permanent audiovisual mod' in the mod manager (you must select it in the 'installed' column to get the checkbox). In that case only graphics and audio will be active, the rule changes will be ignored (if it contains any) unless the first way is also used. Override built-in graphics If a mod supplies an image with the same name and path as one included in the base game (and its atlas is up to date), and the mod is active, the mod's graphics will be used instead of the built-in one. For example, if you include a file named \"Images/OtherIcons/Link.png\" in your mod, you will be overriding the little chain links icon denoting linked lines in Civilopedia. The first part of the path is not relevant for overriding, it controls which of a set of atlas files will carry the image, but for selection in the game only the rest of the path is relevant. So, to override \"Images.Tech/TechIcons/Archery.png\" you could place your image as \"Images/TechIcons/Archery.png\" and it would work because the \"TechIcons/Archery\" part is the key. Please note, as for adding items, your graphics should keep the size and color choices of the original, or the result may be surprising, e.g. when the game tries to tint such an image. Supply additional graphics You will need to supply the graphics for new elements - a new unit needs its icon just as a new nation does. The rules are: The path and name of the image file need to conform to the rule: Image[.AtlasName]/Type-specific/Objectname.png (Type-specific means \"TechIcons\" for a Technology, \"NationIcons\" for a Nation and so on. See vanilla game folders. Objectname is the exact name as defined in json, before translation.) All path parts are case sensitive. Unit Pixel sprites and Tilesets follow special rules. Promotions can be named \" [Unitname] ability \". In such a case, if UnitIcons/Unitname.png exists it will fall back to that unit icon when UnitPromotionIcons/Unitname ability.png is missing. Promotions can be named \"Something I\" (or \" II\" or \" III\"). The suffix will be removed and painted as little stars, only the base UnitPromotionIcons/Something.png will be loaded. The special rules for promotions can be combined, e.g. \" [Warrior] ability III \" will fall back to the Warrior unit icon and paint 3 Stars on it. Additionally, there there are two kinds of images where the game has display capability but does not supply graphics itself, as described in the next paragraphs: Adding Wonder Splash Screens You can add wonder images to mods and they'll be displayed instead of the standard icon when a wonder is finished. The image needs to be a .png and 2:1 ratio so for example 200x100 px. Add the images to /Images/WonderImages/ . They need to be named according to the name field in Buildings.json , so for example \"Temple of Artemis.png\" or \"Stonehenge.png\" Remember, to be compatible with mobile devices, a fresh atlas needs to be generated including these. Adding Leader Portraits The base game comes without Leader Portraits, but is able to display them in greetings, Civilopedia, diplomacy screens, or the nation picker. A mod can supply these, by adding their images to /Images/LeaderIcons/ . The file name must correspond exactly with the leader name of a nation as defined in Nations.json, or they will be ignored. These work best if they are square, between 100x100 and 256x256 pixels, and include some transparent border within that area. For example, here is mod showing how to add leader portraits, which can complement the base game. Sounds Standard values are below. The sounds themselves can be found here . arrow, artillery, bombard, bombing, cannon, chimes, choir, click, coin, construction, elephant, fortify, gdrAttack, horse, jetgun, machinegun, metalhit, missile, nonmetalhit, nuke, paper, policy, promote, setup, shipguns, shot, slider, swap, tankshot, throw, torpedo, upgrade, whoosh . Mods can add their own sounds, as long as any new value in attackSound has a corresponding sound file in the mod's sound folder, using one of the formats mp3, ogg or wav (file name extension must match codec used). Remember, names are case sensitive. Small sizes strongly recommended, Unciv's own sounds use 24kHz joint stereo 8-bit VBR at about 50-100kBps. Override built-in sounds This works like graphics, except no atlas is involved. E.g. you include a sounds/Click.mp3, it will play instead of the normal click sound. These files must stay short and small. A sound larger than 1MB when uncompressed may break or not play at all on mobile devices. Unciv tries to standardize on 24kHz sample rate, joint stereo, low-bitrate VBR (-128kbps) mp3. Only mp3 and ogg formats will be recognized (but an existing mp3 can be overridden with an ogg file). Supply additional music Sound files (mp3 or ogg) in a mod /music folder will be recognized and used when the mod is active. Except for context-specific music as described in the following paragraphs, tracks will play randomly from all available tracks (with a little bias to avoid close repetition of tracks). There is no overriding - a \"thatched-villagers.mp3\" in a mod will play in addition to and with the same likelihood as the file that the base game offers to download for you. There is no hard technical limit on bitrate or length, but large bandwidth requirements may lead to stuttering (The end of a \"next turn\", right before the world map is updated, and with very large maps, is the most likely to cause this). Context-sensitive music: Overview The Music Controller will generally play one track after another, with a pause (can be changed in options) between. While the \"Leave game?\" confirmation dialog is opened playback will fade out and pause and can resume when it is closed. There are various 'triggers' in the game code initiating a choice for a new track. The new track will, if necessary, fade out the currently playing track quickly before it starts playing. Track choice involves context provided by the trigger and a random factor, and an attempt is made to not repeat any track until at least eight others have played. Mods can provide their own music folder, and if they are active its contents will be treated exactly the same as those in the main music folder. Mods should control usage of their tracks by careful choice of file name. Mod developers can watch console output for messages logging track choice with trigger parameters or loading errors. One track is special: The Thatched Villagers (see also credits.md). The game is able to download it if the music folder is empty, and it is played when the music volume slider is used. It is also a fallback track should certain problems occur (a broken file, however, will shut down the player until another trigger happens). Context-sensitive music: List of Triggers Triggers indicate context (call it intent, mood, whatever, it doesn't matter) by optionally providing a prefix and/or suffix to match against the file name. There are a few flags as well influencing choice or behaviour - one flag function is to make prefix or suffix mandatory, meaning if no available file matches the track chooser will do nothing. Otherwise, a next track will always be chosen from the available list by sorting and then picking the first entry. Sorting is done by in order of precedence: Prefix match, Suffix match, Recently played, and a random number. Therefore, as currently no triggers have an empty prefix, files matching none of the prefixes will never play unless there are less than eight files matching the requested prefix. The current list of triggers is as follows: Description Prefix [^M] Suffix [^X] Flags Automatic next-track[^0] Ambient Launch game[^1] Menu Every 10th turn (player civ name) [^M] Peace or War[^2] [^F] New game: Select a mod (mod name) [^M] Theme [^S] New game: Pick a nation for a player (nation name) [^M] Theme or Peace [^S] Diplomacy: Select player (nation name) [^M] Peace or War[^3] [^S] First contact[^4] (civ name) [^M] Theme or Peace [^X] War declaration[^5] (civ name) [^M] War [^X] Civ defeated (civ name) Defeat [^X] Golden Age (civ name) [^M] Golden [^X] Wonder built (wonder name) [^M] Wonder [^X] Tech researched (tech name) [^M] Researched [^X] Map editor: Select nation start location (nation name) [^M] Theme [^S] Options: Volume slider or Default track downloaded [^D] Options: Click currently playing label[^6] [^M] Ambient [^S] Legend: [^N]: Not implemented [^M]: Prefix must match.

For example, a very simple units.json may look like: [ { \"name\": \"Warrior\", \"cost\": 16 }, { \"name\": \"Spearman\", \"cost\": 24, \"promotions\": [\"Shock I\", \"Drill I\"] } ] This file contains two unit objects, one for a warrior and one for a spearman. These objects have different attributes, in this case \"name\", \"cost\" and \"promotions\". All these attributes have a certain type, a String (text) for \"name\", an Integer for \"cost\" and a List of Strings for \"promotions\". There are different types of attributes: | type | notes | | --------- | ----- | | String | A word or sentence. Should be between double quotes (\") | | Integer | A number. Can be both positive or negative. Should not be between quotes | | Boolean | A value that can either be 'true' or 'false'. Should not be between quotes | | List of [type] | If multiple values could apply (such as with the promotions above), they should be put inside a list. Each element of the list should be written like a normal attribute, seperated by comma's, and enclosed between square braces. E.g.: [\"Shock I\", \"Shock II\"] or [1, 2, 3]. | | Object | The most complicated type of attribute. An object is comprised of multiple attributes, each of which again has a type. These attributes have a key (the part before the \":\") and a value (the part behind it). For an example, see below. | Example of a Buildings.json adding a new \"Cultural Library\" building which gives +50% science and +50% culture: [ { \"name\": \"Cultural Library\" \"percentStatBonus\" : {\"science\": 50, \"culture\": 50} } ] The keys in this example are \"science\" and \"culture\", and both have the value \"50\". In some sense you can see from these types that JSON files themselves are actually a list of objects, each describing a single building, unit or something else. Information on JSON files used in the game Many parts of Unciv are moddable, and for each there is a seperate json file. There is a json file for buildings, for units, for promotions units can have, for technologies, etc. The different new buildings or units you define can also have lots of different attributes, though not all are required. Below are tables documenting all the different attributes everything can have. Only the attributes which are noted to be 'required' must be provided.

Unfortunately, the game only understands code, so mods are our way to give a degree of freedom to those of us who don't code. Mods can add, replace and remove basic game definitions, such as units, nations, buildings, improvements, resources and terrains. Games loaded with these mods will function according to the mod definition. The game only knows how to recognize existing definitions, so you can't add new unique abilities to nations/units/buildings/etc, only play around with existing ones There are two kinds of mods: Extension mods - these add new nations/units/buildings/resources to a base ruleset - can be either to the default ruleset, or to a base ruleset mod. Easy to do and probably the better place to get started. Base Ruleset mods - these replace the entire existing ruleset - tech tree, units, policies, nations etc - to give an entirely different experience than the base game. These generally require quite a bit of work, but give a whole new experience, and so are the most popular. Creating and editing mods from your phone is NOT RECOMMENDED - it's much easier using a desktop device! Audiovisual Mods In addition to changing the rules - or even without doing so, mods can override existing graphics or sounds, or add music tracks. The game also has the ability to display graphics that are not included in the base game at all, such as leader portrait or wonder splash images, that must be provided by mods. For details, see Audiovisual Mods . Custom tilesets are closely related, see Creating a custom tileset . Such mods are candidates for the \"Permanent audiovisual mod\" switch available on the Mod Management Screen. Note that this feature includes graphics or sounds from the selected mod in all games, even those started before installing the mod. In case of a mod bringing both changed rules and audiovisuals, the 'permanent' feature will include only the media on all games, to use the rules you will still need to select the mod for a new game. Mod names Mods need to conform to github repo naming rules, but best stay simple and use only letters, digits, and dashes - . Dashes are automatically converted to spaces for display and use within Unciv. Many punctuation or extended unicode characters might work, but at best potential users won't find them attractive, at worst we'll refuse support when you run into problems :smiling_imp: Mod components Mods are located in a /mods directory, on Desktop that should be next to your .jar file. Mods typically have 2 subfolders: jsons - here you should put files that alter the data of game objects, the order of the files is as in the base json files . More information on these can be found here Images - here you should put game images, as in the base image files . Please read the atlas chapter for important details. In order to remove objects from the game, you'll need to create a ModOptions file in the /jsons subfolder - there's an example here In a base ruleset mod, ALL the original objects are removed - this is done by adding a \"isBaseRuleset\":true configuration to your modOptions file, like so For an example, you can refer to the example mod - just download the Example-Aliens-Mod and put it in a /mods folder next to the jar, run Unciv, start a new game, and you'll be able to enable the mod, which will allow to you pick Aliens as a playable civilization! If you want to add a new civilization as a mod, you should check out the Civ making instructions to see what's required, or see the example Aliens mod =) More on Images and the texture atlas Images are combined (at runtime) into texture images with an 'atlas', so if you see \"game.atlas\" and \"game.png\" files being generated, now you know what for. Most mods will need only one pair of those, the base game has around four. When the game runs from a packaged distribution (android, jar), the texture+atlas files alone are relevant, so you need to include them in your repository and keep them up to date. Actually omitting the original images would work for these uses, but we still recommend including them, so developers running from source can access them. If your mod has lots of images (or large ones), the textures might 'spill' into additional texture \".png\" files - 2048x2048 is the limit for a single texture pack. This is not good for performance, which is why the base game controls which kinds of images go together into one texture(+atlas). This works for mods, too: Create not only one Images folder, but several, the additional ones named \"Images.xyz\", where xyz will become the filename of the additional texture file (So don't use both Images and Images.game - those will clash). Look at the Unciv base game to get a better idea how that works. To minimize texture swaps, try to group them by the situation where in the game they are needed. You can distibute by folder, but having the same subfolders under several \"Images.xyz\" and distributing the images between them will also work. Adding maps to mods You can also add maps to mods, so they'll be available to players who download your mod. A mod can also be maps-only, if all you want to do is share your maps. When you've finished making your map in the Map Editor, save it, and it will be in the /maps folder of your game. Copy it to a /maps folder in your mod , and you're done! Getting your mod out there In order to make your mod downloadable by anyone, you need to create a Github repository (instructions here ) The Images and jsons folders need to be in the root directory of the repo - see here for example. You can then manually download the mod from within the Mod Manager in Unciv: From Unciv's main screen, click \"Mods\" Click \"Download mod from URL\", and enter the location of your Github page The game will automatically download and extract your mod, and it'll be ready to use! Once you've tested that your mod CAN be downloaded, and that it works well once downloaded, you're ready for the final stage - GETTING IT TO THE USERS AUTOMATICALLY. In order to do this, all you need to do is: Go to your Github page Click the gear icon next to the About (top-right part of the page) In 'Topics', add \"unciv-mod\" When you open your app, it will query Github's list of repos with that topic , and now YOUR repo will appear there! I have the mod, now what? The primary use of mods is to add them when starting a new game, or configuring a map. This will mean that both the ruleset of the mod, and the images, will be in use for that specific game/map. For mods which are primarily visual or audio, there is a second use - through the mod manager, you can enable them as permanent audiovisual mods . This means that the images, sounds (or upcoming: music) from the mod will replace the original media everywhere in the game. Mod location for manual loading of mods In general, you should never be manually-loading your mods - not only is this clunky, it's also more error-prone. Unless you have a very specific use-case, you probably shouldn't be doing this. In Android, they should go into the Android/data/com.unciv.app/files/mods directory. In Chromebook, go to \"Play files\", should be on the sidebar on the left side of the window under \"My files\". Click the 3 vertical dots on the top right-hand corner of the window below the \"X\". If the option \"Show all Play folders\" does not have a check next to it click it. You should see some new files that appear on your screen. Now navigate to Android/data/com.unciv.app/files/mods When loading a mod, it needs to be in its own folder in /mods - this is how you will work when you're editing your mod.

Civ Force Ranking The civs Force Ranking is based on the sum of all their units' Force Evaluation (cities are not counted). Only half the Force of naval units is counted. This is multiplied by a gold modifier equal to the square root of current gold, as a percentage.

Once you have downloaded the file open it and follow the instructions on screen. Now that you have Java 8 installed it's time to download the latest Unciv JAR. This can be done from the releases screen here on Github. Download the file called Unciv.jar.

Alternatively, you could create a 'Unciv.sh' file containing that line, and then run the new file, to allow you to create shortcuts etc. (Sadly UnCiv dose not auto update when installing it using this method on macOS so you will need to download the latest Unciv.jar from Github every time you want to update the game.)

If more than 1 unique is added, the notification will be shown multiple times due to a bug. excludedDifficulties List of Strings defaults to None A list of all difficulties on which this reward may not be awarded The exact algorithm for choosing a reward is the following: Create a list of all possible rewards, with rewards with a higher weight appearing multiple times. A reward with weight one will appear once, a reward with weight two will appear twice, etc. Shuffle this list Try give rewards starting from the top of the list. If any of the uniques of the rewards is valid in this context, reward it and stop trying more rewards. Notifications Some of the rewards ruins can give will have results that are not deterministic when writing it in the JSON, so creating a good notification for it would be impossible. An example for this would be the \"Gain [50]-[100] [Gold]\" unique, which will give a random amount of gold. For this reason, we allow some notifications to have parameters, in which values will be filled, such as \"You found [goldAmount] gold in the ruins!\". All the uniques which have this property can be found below. Unique Parameters Free [] found in the ruins The name of the unit will be filled in the notification, including unique units of the nation [] population in a random city The name of the city to which the population is added will be filled in the notification Gain []-[] [] The exact amount of the stat gained will be filled in the notification [] free random reasearchable Tech(s) from the [] The notification must have placeholders equal to the number of techs granted this way.

The region type corresponds to the start bias of the civs as they are distributed. The region type also determines start placement and what luxuries will appear in the region. Example How to define region behavior in your mod The game will work without any extra json definitions, but if you want the region system to work well when generating maps for your mod, these are the relevant uniques to define. Terrains.json \"Always Fertility [amount] for Map Generation\", \"[amount] to Fertility for Map Generation\" - these determine how good a terrain is for purposes of dividing land up fairly. The numbers are arbitrary but should reflect the relative value of the terrains. \"A Region is formed with at least [amount]% [simpleTerrain] tiles, with priority [amount]\", \"A Region is formed with at least [amount]% [simpleTerrain] tiles and [simpleTerrain] tiles, with priority [amount]\" - these determine the rules for when a region is classified as eg a \"desert\" region. Terrains are evaluated in ascending priority order, so in the base ruleset tundra regions are checked first. \"A Region can not contain more [simpleTerrain] tiles than [simpleTerrain] tiles\" - a useful compliment to the sum-of-two-terrains criterium above, if both terrains are in and of themselves terrain types.

You don't need to download anything, all translation work can be done on the Github website :) When you feel that you're ready to add your translation to the game, you'll need to create a merge request, which takes your changes and puts them into the main version of the game - it's pretty straightforward once you do it App store text There are two special entries that won't show in the game but are automatically used to provide short and long descriptions for F-Droid (and possibly other stores soon). They're near the beginning of each language file and marked \"Fastlane\". See the comments just above each for help, and where to find the actual english original to translate. Do not overlook the note on line breaks in Other notes for the full description! App store images The stores can show screenshots. To show translated versions of these images a different approach is necessary: they must be merged into appropriate subfolders of [fastlane/metadata/android] in the Unciv repository. If in doubt on how to do this, look at the existing ones for the proper dimensions and offer your version using an issue. Hints: relative paths and names must match the 'en-US' subfolder with 'en-US' replaced with the two-letter ISO code of your language. You can use Add file - Upload files if the folder you need already exits. Using the github site to create a PR with new folders is possible, but outside the scope of this document. Pitfalls If a translation template (the stuff to the left of \" = \") contains square brackets, you will have to include each of them verbatim in your translation, but you can move them. Upper/lower case is relevant! e.g. All [personFilter] are cool can be translated as Tous les [personFilter] sont cool , but not as Tous les [personnages] sont cool , and neither as Nous sommes vraiment cool . Failing this is the main cause of your PR's showing up with red \"x\"es and \"checks failed\". Blanks: Watch out for blanks at the start of a line or two of them before the equals sign. If you got such a line - those blanks are part of the translation key and must not be deleted on the left side, and you should probably also include them in your translation (unless your language doesn't need spaces to separate things). Changes in the templates: When we find a typo in the english texts and fix it, or marginally change a wording, the template changes. Often the old template will not be automatically fixed in the existing translations, because it's a lot of work and in most cases the developers cannot be sure the translation is still correct. For you, that might look like your translations are simply disappearing with an update. In such a case, you have the option to use github's history to look up old versions, copy the old translation, place it where the new template now says \"requires translation\" - and proofread and adapt it to the new english version. The history link for each file is in the top right area and has a nice round clock icon. Wait, what just happened? Like most open-source projects, Unciv is developed at Github, so if you don't have a user you'll first have to create one. The way Github works is the following: You create a 'fork' repo, i.e. copy, of Unciv that belongs to your user (myUser/Unciv) You make changes to your copy. These changes are called a 'commit'. You make a pull request, which is basically asking for the changes you made on myUser/Unciv to be merged into the main repo (yairm210/Unciv) When you ask to 'edit' a file in yairm210/Unciv, these stages happen automatically - but it's important to understand what's happening behind the scenes do you understand where the changes actually are! Why not use a crowdsourcing translation website like <...>? Testing. Currently, translations undergo a number of tests for verification. This allows some language changes to be accepted and others not, and it's all in the same platform with the same tests. External translation tools don't allow for this. History and revisions. This is what Git was made for, and nothing like it exists in the world. I'm not exaggerating. Release cycle. We release versions weekly. If we need to take information from an external website every time, and for many that I've checked - you need to download the info as a csv or something and convert it. Every extra step hurts. Discussions. Most crowdsourcing translation websites don't allow for discussions and corrections on translations. Github does. Mass changes. If we're changing the source of the translation but want to keep the various destinations (say, we change \"Gold from trade routes +[amount]%\" to \"+[amount]% Gold from trade routes\"), if all the translation files are in Git we can do that in 1 minute. If it's external, this varies greatly. Other notes Make sure that you make the changes in the 'master' branch in your repo! Each untranslated phrase will have a \"requires translation\" line before it, so you can quickly find them. You don't need to remove them yourself if you don't want to - they will be automatically removed the next time we rebuild the file. Order of lines does not matter, they will be rearranged automatically each release. Do as much as you're comfortable with - it's a big game with a lot of named objects, so don't feel pressured into doing everything =) Some entries have line breaks expressed as \\n : Your translation can and in most cases should use them as well, but you do not need to distribute them exactly as in the original. Try to find a translation that reads nicely, then place the line break codes at roughly the same intervals as the original uses (less if your language's glyphs are wider than latin ones). Important: You cannot use normal line breaks, you must use the \\n codes, normal line breaks are not part of a translation. Note that Right-to-Left languages such as Arabic and Hebrew are not supported by the framework :/ Translation generation - for developers The automatic template generation Before releasing every version, we regenerate the translation files. Sometimes, new strings (names, uniques, etc) are added in the json files. In order to not have to add every single one to the translation files manually, we have a class - TranslationFileWriter - that, for every language: Goes over the template.properties and copies translation lines For every json file in the jsons folder Selects all string values - both in objects, and in arrays in objects, to any inheritance or nesting level. (Collections that can be parsed must be derived from List or AbstractCollection) Generates a 'key = value' line Scans knowledge from UniqueType and UniqueParameterType instances and generates 'key = value' lines for them This means that every text that ISN'T in the jsons or the UniqueType system needs to be added manually to the template.properties in order to be translated! That also means if you've been adding new json structures you (or someone) should check TranslationFileWriter and see if it is able to cope with them. Rules for templates added manually Building a new UI and doing something like popup.add(\"Hello world\".toLabel()) is a typical case: This is not contained in json data, so you'll have to add the template to template.properties yourself. For this example, adding Hello world = somewhere in a line of its own could suffice. Note the space at the end - it's absolutely required, and see to it your editor does not destroy your work. If you want to make sure, use Android Studio for git integration, but edit the file in an external editor, then run the unit tests locally before pushing. (to do: add link for instructions how to do that) Leading spaces on a translation line or more than one space between the text and the = would mean these spaces are a key part of the string to be translated . That can work, but be warned: translators often overlook that those spaces are a required part of both template and translation, so if you can do without, then doing without is safer. Translation templates can use placeholders, and there's two varieties: [] and {} . Square ones take precedence over curly ones, and nesting works only with a single level of curly nested inside one level of square. I both cases the symbols themselves ( []{} ) are removed by the translation engine. Square brackets [] mean the outer and inner components are both translated individually. The outer template will use alias names inside the brackets - example: Your code outputs \"Everyone gains [5000] gold!\", then the translation template should be \"Everyone gains [amount] gold! = \". The translation engine would translate the \"Everyone gains [] gold!\" and \"5000\" individually and reassemble them - of course, the number is simply passed through. But in other cases that could be e.g. a Unit name that would be translated, and you could trust that translations for units are already handled just fine. Note that uniques often use the feature, but it is in no way limited to them. It it makes life easier for translators, use it. Curly brackets {} are simpler - the contents within the brackets are translated individually, while the outer parts are passed through verbatim. Example: \"+$amount${Fonts.gold} {Gold}\".toLabel() - note the first ${} is a kotlin template while the second pair becomes part of the string. It tells the translation engine to ignore the numbers and the symbol but to translate the single word \"Gold\". Rules for all sources The [], {} and <> bracket types are used internally and cannot be part of a translatable text. Use () instead. Translation generation - for modders If you can run desktop with the mod installed, then provide at least one valid translation of something that is present in your mod or the base game in that file. The file can be empty otherwise. Now run Unciv and use options-advanced-\"Generate translation files\". Reload your translation file and it will have added all the necessary \"requires translation\" entries specific to your mod (I repeat, works only if there's at least one valid entry already there). AFAIK you can also override base game translations, but those won't be output by the \"Generate translation files\" tool. Here's an example: Say you have a new nation in your mod named \"The Borg\". You create the translations folder, create an empty file named, say, \"Hungarian.properties\", add \"The Borg = The Borg\" to that, run Unciv and run the translation generator from options. Reload the new file, bingo all what Unciv would like to see is there. If you're modding on Android only - don't. That said, it's not impossible, just make do without the described tool and add everything yourself, test, rinse, repeat. Be aware that the game does not read changed files from disk if it doesn't need to, so on Droid you could either edit locally and force-stop to ensure changes are read, or edit on a github repo and re-install from there, or... Adding new languages in a mod is not supported (because the completionPercentages.properties file determines which languages Unciv deems as known, and I'm not saying impossible as one could manipulate their GameSettings.json). Remember, exact case is important both in translations left of the \"=\" and file names. More about translating Sometimes you'll see a English.properties in the translation folder. For example, if you see gold = credits in English.properties , It means the word 'gold' will be displayed as 'credits' in the English version. So in your translation file, though 'gold' is already translated in vanilla unciv, you should sill translate the line. gold = credits ( <- in your language) NOT:gold = gold ( <- in your language) (The example comes from the mod Alpha-Frontier . Thanks @carriontrooper.) Most Base Ruleset mods contain this feature, so you'd better be careful translating those, or you'll make the translation work really 'amuzing':D Another thing about translation is 'extra translating'. The aim of 'extra translating' is to make your mod translation closer to the gaming content and give the players a better gaming experience. A great example is from @SpacedOutChicken's mod Deciv. @The Bucketeer made some 'extra translations' which are excellent. (link is here) I've got a few lines here so you can take it as a reference.

You don't need to download anything, all translation work can be done on the Github website :) When you feel that you're ready to add your translation to the game, you'll need to create a merge request, which takes your changes and puts them into the main version of the game - it's pretty straightforward once you do it","title":"Starting out"},{"location":"Other/Translating/#app-store-text","text":"There are two special entries that won't show in the game but are automatically used to provide short and long descriptions for F-Droid (and possibly other stores soon).

Changes in the templates: When we find a typo in the english texts and fix it, or marginally change a wording, the template changes.
